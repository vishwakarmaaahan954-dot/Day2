# Token-based Game Score Tracker

## Description of the Project

The Token-based Game Score Tracker is a smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that revolutionizes gaming by integrating blockchain technology with traditional scoring systems. This contract automatically tracks player achievements and rewards them with cryptocurrency tokens based on their in-game performance.

The system works by maintaining a comprehensive record of each player's score and automatically distributing token rewards when specific milestones are reached. Players earn 10 tokens for every 100 points scored in the game, creating a direct correlation between gaming skill and financial rewards. The contract ensures transparency, immutability, and fairness in score tracking and reward distribution.

Key features include automated player registration, real-time score updates, instant token rewards, and comprehensive statistics tracking. The smart contract eliminates the need for centralized game servers to manage rewards, reducing fraud and ensuring players receive their earned tokens immediately upon achieving score milestones.

## Vision of the Project

Our vision is to create a decentralized gaming ecosystem where players are truly rewarded for their skills and dedication. We aim to bridge the gap between traditional gaming and the emerging play-to-earn economy by providing a transparent, fair, and automated reward system.

We envision a future where:
- **Players own their achievements** - All scores and rewards are recorded on the blockchain, giving players true ownership of their gaming accomplishments
- **Skill equals value** - Gaming prowess directly translates to financial rewards, creating new opportunities for professional gamers and casual players alike
- **Transparency rules** - Every score update and token distribution is publicly verifiable, eliminating disputes and ensuring fair play
- **Global accessibility** - Players from anywhere in the world can participate and earn rewards without geographical restrictions or payment processor limitations

This project represents a stepping stone toward a more equitable gaming industry where players are stakeholders in the games they love and excel at.
